# Creating a Simple Unity Project: From GameObject to Script

I'll walk you through creating a very simple Unity project that will help you understand the basics of working with GameObjects and scripts. This tutorial is perfect for beginners and will cover the essential concepts.

## Step 1: Setting Up Unity

First, you'll need to have Unity installed. If you don't have it yet:

1. Download and install Unity Hub from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/download)
2. Open Unity Hub and install the latest stable version of Unity
3. Create a new 3D project

## Step 2: Understanding the Unity Interface

When you open your new project, you'll see several windows:

- **Scene View**: Where you build and design your game visually
- **Game View**: Shows what your game camera sees
- **Hierarchy**: Lists all GameObjects in your scene
- **Project**: Shows all assets in your project
- **Inspector**: Shows properties of selected objects

## Step 3: Creating Your First GameObject

Let's create a simple cube that will be our player:

1. Right-click in the Hierarchy window
2. Select 3D Object > Cube
3. In the Inspector, rename it to "Player"
4. Position it in your scene by adjusting its Transform component in the Inspector:
   - Position: X=0, Y=0.5, Z=0
   - Rotation: X=0, Y=0, Z=0
   - Scale: X=1, Y=1, Z=1

## Step 4: Creating a Ground

1. Right-click in the Hierarchy window
2. Select 3D Object > Plane
3. Rename it to "Ground"
4. Set its position to X=0, Y=0, Z=0

## Step 5: Creating Your First Script

Now let's create a script to make our player move:

1. Right-click in the Project window
2. Select Create > Folder and name it "Scripts"
3. Right-click on the Scripts folder
4. Select Create > C# Script and name it "PlayerController"
5. Double-click the script to open it in your code editor

Replace the default code with this simple movement script:

```csharp:PlayerController.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Variables that appear in the Inspector
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    
    // Update is called once per frame
    private void Update()
    {
        // Get input from arrow keys or WASD
        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float verticalInput = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
        
        // Calculate movement direction
        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(horizontalInput, 0f, verticalInput);
        
        // Move the player
        transform.Translate(movement * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

## Step 6: Attaching the Script to Your GameObject

1. Save the script
2. Return to Unity (it will compile your script)
3. Select the "Player" cube in the Hierarchy
4. In the Inspector, click "Add Component"
5. Type "PlayerController" and select your script

## Step 7: Testing Your Game

1. Click the Play button at the top of the Unity editor
2. Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your cube around
3. Press Play again to exit play mode

## Step 8: Adding a Camera Follow Script (Optional)

If you want the camera to follow your player:

1. Create a new C# script called "CameraFollow"
2. Add this code:

```csharp:CameraFollow.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class CameraFollow : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Transform target;
    [SerializeField] private Vector3 offset = new Vector3(0, 5, -7);
    [SerializeField] private float smoothSpeed = 0.125f;
    
    private void LateUpdate()
    {
        if (target == null)
            return;
            
        Vector3 desiredPosition = target.position + offset;
        Vector3 smoothedPosition = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, desiredPosition, smoothSpeed);
        transform.position = smoothedPosition;
        
        transform.LookAt(target);
    }
}
```

3. Attach this script to the Main Camera
4. In the Inspector, drag the Player cube to the "Target" field

## Understanding the Basics

- **GameObjects**: Everything in Unity is a GameObject (your player, enemies, cameras, etc.)
- **Components**: GameObjects have components that define their behavior (Transform, Collider, Scripts, etc.)
- **Transform**: Every GameObject has a Transform component that defines its position, rotation, and scale
- **Scripts**: Custom C# code that controls GameObject behavior
- **MonoBehaviour**: The base class for Unity scripts that can be attached to GameObjects
- **Update()**: A function called every frame, perfect for handling input and movement

## Key Unity Concepts

- **Time.deltaTime**: Makes movement frame-rate independent
- **Input.GetAxis()**: Gets input from keyboard/controller in a standardized way
- **SerializeField**: Makes private variables visible in the Inspector
- **transform**: A shortcut to access the GameObject's Transform component

This simple project demonstrates the fundamental workflow in Unity:
1. Create GameObjects in the scene
2. Write scripts to define behavior
3. Attach scripts to GameObjects
4. Configure properties in the Inspector
5. Test and iterate
