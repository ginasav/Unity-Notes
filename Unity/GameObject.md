A **GameObject** is essentially an *invisible container*: it has a position in space, a rotation and a scale. We can fill this container with **components** to add extra features.

For example, if we put a [[SpriteRender]] component, we can slap an asset as the image of our `GameObject`. 

The **Camera** is itself a GameObject in the Hierarchy (the panel to the left in the Unity Editor).
